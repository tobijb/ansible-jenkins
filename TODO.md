## Things to do


### High Priority
- Templatize /etc/default/jenkins?  Perhaps just do an include template that overrides any of the previously set values and appends to the end
- How to enable security?
  - What about Github OAuth, that requires callbacks from Github and external accessibility
- Plugin configuration management
  - Can this be done with Groovy scripts?
