# This is an Ansible inventory file in INI format. You can define a list of
# hosts and groups to be managed by this particular inventory.

# Hosts listed under [ansible_controllers] will have common DebOps plays
# ran against them. It will include services such as iptables, DNS, Postfix,
# sshd configuration and more.

# hostname.vagrant.dev is resolved by the landrush plugin for Vagrant, both on your
# local host and on the guest itself.
